## 👋 About Me

I am a Software Developer with hands-on experience in Android development and backend systems. I have worked with Kotlin, Java, Jetpack Compose, Spring Boot, and REST APIs. After completing my MSc in Electronics and Telecommunication, I built practical projects focusing on clean architecture, offline support, and real-world problem solving. I am eager to contribute to reliable, scalable applications, especially in domains like Android, backend systems, and POS/payment solutions.
